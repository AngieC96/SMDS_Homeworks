# Statistical Methods for Data Science - Homeworks

This repository contains the homeworks for the course **"Statistical Methods for Data Science"** of Spring 2020 by N. Torelli, R. Bellio and L. Egidi for the Data Science and Scientific Computing of University of Trieste, in collaboration with SISSA, University of Udine and ICTP.

## Sources

The assigned exercises could come from different books/sources, generally we will adopt the following abbreviations:

- **DAAG**: for the exercises from *[Data Analysis and Graphics Using R](http://www.pindex.com/uploads/post_docs/Maindonald%20Data%20Analysis%20and%20Graphics(PINDEX-DOC-6953).pdf)*, by John Maindonald and W.John Braun.
- **CS**: for the exercises from *[Core Statistics](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~sw15190/core-statistics.pdf)*, by Simon N. Wood.
- **LAB**: for the exercises contained in the [laboratory sessions](https://moodle2.units.it/course/view.php?id=5505) held on *Microsoft Teams*.
- **LEC**: for the exercises from theoretical lectures.


## Homeworks

In this section are listed the homeworks assigned from the previously cited sources, alongside the group name, team composition, work division and grade received. Even though homeworks were splitted between team members to make their completion faster, they are reviewed entirely by all team members in order to ensure their correctness.
